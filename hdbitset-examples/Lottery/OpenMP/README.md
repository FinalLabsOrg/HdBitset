This example generates a random bitset of a gradually increasing size and tries to guess it by generating other bitsets.
OpenMP is used for parallel processing.
Uniform bitsets are not allowed during the generation and therefore size-1 is applicable for the calculation of the expected values.
Sizes of about 30 and above begin to require a substantial amount of time.
